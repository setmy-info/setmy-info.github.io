## ML input

**Raw Data**: This directory could contain raw, unprocessed data files, such as CSV, JSON, XML, or files in other
formats.

**Preprocessed Data**: This directory could contain data files that have been preprocessed and are ready to be used with
a machine learning model. Preprocessing may involve handling missing values, normalization, scaling, or other data
preparation steps.

**Train Data**: In this directory, you could store data files specifically intended for training, along with their
corresponding labels or targets.

**Test Data**: Similarly to the training data, you could store test data files in a separate directory for evaluating
and testing the model's performance.

**Validation Data**: If you are using separate validation data, you could store it in a separate directory.

**External Data**: If you are using external datasets or sources, you could create a dedicated directory for those data.

**Labels**: If you are working on a supervised learning problem, you could create a directory for storing the labels or
targets.

**Data Augmentation**: If you are using data augmentation techniques, you may create a directory to store the generated
augmented versions of the data.

**Data Splits**: If you are dividing your data into training, testing, and validation sets, you could create directories
for each data split.

**Data Exploration**: If you are conducting exploratory work or analysis related to the input data, you could create a
directory specifically for data exploration.

**Data Sources**: If the input data comes from different sources, you could create a directory with subdirectories for
each data source.

Test data and validation data are both part of evaluating the performance of a machine learning model, but they have
different roles and purposes:

Notea:

Test data is a separate dataset used for evaluating the performance of a model after training and validation. Test data
allows you to assess the model's generalization and its ability to work with new, unseen data. Test data should
represent the real-world environment in which the model will eventually be deployed. Test data should not be used for
training or adjusting model parameters but solely for evaluating the final performance of the model.

Validation data is a subset of the dataset used during the model training process for assessing its performance and
selecting parameters. During training, validation data is used for parameter tuning, such as hyperparameter selection,
model complexity adjustment, or other decisions related to the training process. Validation data helps assess the
model's performance during training and helps prevent overfitting or underfitting.

## ML output

**Parameters**: In this directory, you can store files that contain your model's hyperparameters and configurations.
This may include a text file, a JSON file, or other formats that specify the values of the parameters used.

**Models**: In this directory, you can store files of trained machine learning models. Depending on the storage format
used by TensorFlow, it may include TensorFlow SavedModel files (.pb), SavedModel format files, or H5 format files (for
Keras models).

**Weights**: If you are training a deep learning network, you can save weight files in a separate directory. These files
contain the learned weights and biases during training, which can be used later for model reproduction and usage.

**Reports**: In this directory, you can store various reports, including performance analysis, visualizations, logs, and
other result documents. This may include test reports, performance graphs, log files, and similar documents that provide
insights into your model's behavior and performance.

**Generated Data**: If you generate synthetic data or use data generation with your model, you can separate and store
those data files in this directory. This may include synthesized data files that can be used for result reproduction or
sharing with others.
