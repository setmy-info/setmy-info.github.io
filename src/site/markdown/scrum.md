## Suggestions

### Issue management

    * Epic: top or root level product backlog item (PBI). Written by product owner. Can contain N number of Stories.
        * Story: written by product owner together with development team, usually at refinement meeting or at sprint planning. Can contain N number of sub-tasks.
            * (Sup-)task: tasks to be done to implement story. Written by develpoment team.

Refinement meeting (or longer sprint planning): meeting with whole Scrum team (PO, SM and dev. team).

For fine Story and task granulization:

1. PO: use UI to show what is existing, what should be after Story implementation: what, where and how. Acceptance criterias. What when appears etc.
2. Un-implemented things in another increment/iteration.
3. Task writing: by layers (UI, controller, service, DAO).
4. Task writing: by artifacts main code and test code.

Other:

1. Found bugs are first in line to be fixed before sprint end!
2. Use mock data for example for FE development.
3. Use WIP limit: maximum number of stories under development.
4. User story format. Team defines sub-tasks what should be done to implement whole task.

### Sprint planning

* 4h for 2 week sprint: split it to refinement (preplanning) meeting.
* Sprint goal
* Sprint backlog
* Scrum master
* Product owner
* Dev. team

1. What can be delivered in the Increment resulting8 from the upcoming Sprint?
2. How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

### Daily Scrum

Strictly:

* 15min max, 
* Scrum master
* Dev. team

1. What did you do to acomp. sprint goal?
2. What do yo do to acomp. sprint goal?
3. Impediments?

After daily freeform speach between persons who need to discuss deeper

### Sprint review

* 2h for 2 weeks max
* Dev. team
* Stakeholders
* Scrum master
* Collaborators discuss about next things
* Potentially shippable product

### Sprint retrospective

* 2,5% of sprint length max (2h 2 week sprint)
* Scrum master
* Dev. team
1. What went and is done well?
2. What didint go well and need to change?
3. Action points + person

## Checklist

* Are team stable?
* Is team same in the sprint?
* Are actionpoints or some substitute used?
* Clearly understandable tasks?
* Independent
* Negotiable - no specific contract fir features
* Valuable
* Estimable
* Small
* Testable - verifable
* SMART principle
* integrate by one team only

## Scrum implementations elements

* Spike / AP
* Epic (with uncertain estimation), US/Issue (bug/defect, technical + AC; certain estimation), task - per layer, component, 
* Done Done Done Done
* Goal
* WIP
* Team velocity and v.graph
* Temporary pair programming
* Burn down chart: sprint and release
* Burn up chart
* DoR
* DoD
* User Story lead vs sprint planning subtasking ang GANT graph.
* One team one board
* All PBI-s for all dev. team
* Sprint planning and refinement
* x (smoke acceptance) testing
* Strictly pull
* Impediments, standup and scrum master
* Timebox
* After standup meeting
