## Information

    [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

### Sugestions

Epic: top or root level product backlog item (PBI). Written by product owner. Can contain N number of Stories.
Story: written by product owner together with development team, usually at refinement meeting or at sprint planning. Can contain N number of sub-tasks.
(Sup-)task: tasks to be done to implement story. Written by develpoment team.

Refinement meeting (or longer sprint planning): meeting with whole Scrum team (PO, SM and dev. team).

For fine Story and task granulization:
1. PO: use UI to show what is existing, what should be after Story implementation: what, where and how. Acceptance criterias. What when appears etc.
2. Un-implemented things in another increment/iteration.
3. Task writing: by layers (UI, controller, service, DAO).
4. Task writing: by artifacts main code and test code.

Other:
1. Found bugs are first in line to be fixed before sprint end!
2. Use mock data for example for FE development.
3. Use WIP limit: maximum number of stories under development.
4. User story format. Team defines sub-tasks what should be done to implement whole task.


 Sprint planning
* 4h for 2 week sprint: split it to refinement (preplanning) meeting.
* Sprint goal
* Sprint backlog
* Scrum master
* Product owner
* Dev. team
: What can be delivered in the Increment resulting8 from the upcoming Sprint?
: How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?


- Daily Scrum strict part
* 15min max, 
* Scrum master
* Dev. team
:What did you do to acomp. sprint goal?
:What do yo do to acomp. sprint goal?
:Impediments?
- After daily freeform speach


- Sprint review
* 2h for 2 weeks max
* Dev. team
* Stakeholders
* Scrum master
* Collaborators discuss about next things
* Potentially shippable product


- Sprint retrospective
* 2,5% of sprint length max (2h 2 week sprint)
* Scrum master
* Dev. team
: What went and is done well?
: What didint go well and need to change?
: Action points + person


Check list
* Are team stable?
* Is team same in the sprint?
* Are actionpoints used or some substitute is used?
* Clearly understandable tasks?
* Independent
* Negotiable - no specific contract fir features
* Valuable
* Estimable
* Small
* Testable - verifable
* SMART principle


Integrate by one team only.
Working code every day.

SCRUMMI RAKENDUSI
* Spike / AP
* Epic (with uncertain estimation), US/Issue (bug/defect, technical + AC; certain estimation), task - per layer, component, 
* Done Done Done Done
* Goal
* WIP
* Team velocity and v.graph
* Temporary pair programming
* Burn down: sprint and release
* DoD
* User Story lead vs sprint planning subtasking ang GANT graph.
* One team one board
* sprint planning and refinement
* pipeline: flow is restricted
* x (smoke acceptance) testing
* strictly pull
* Impediments, standup and scrum master
* timebox
* After standup meeting
