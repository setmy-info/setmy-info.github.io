# Working coherently, simultaneously in separate organization units

Other organization units (administrators, DevOps, libraries, components developers, ...) should not use force to add
requirements, work and rules for development. OU should not add obstacles at dev team working time. Everything should go
through conversation, agreed backlog and backlog prioritization, readiness questions for all OU's.

Complexity should be shared.

Prioritized dev team backlog is more important than OU wishes (even highly important ones) - everyone had chance to add
needs, wishes, opinion, check work list (backlog) and priority.

Importance of PBI is reflected by prioritization.

There are some exceptions, but these are reflected by PBI importance (priority in backlog).

These rules are pushing other OU roles to be a part of team.

Examples:

1. Networking rules (firewall out all non TLS connections), role settings etc should not be changed, when administrator
   finds that need to be changed right away. Admin should visit and use sprint planning and refinement meetings for
   that. Inform PO and ask, when Dev team is ready or ask sprint cancellation, say task/incident importance etc.
2. New library, that should be used by dev team in projects, should not be blocked and forced to use new one. Depends on
   importance, but minor things should not interrupt dev team work. Library development team should ask others dev teams
   about readiness to switch to new library. Constant conversation.
3. Administrators and monitoring units are usually trying to simplify their work so much, that they should not do
   anything (everything should go smoothly and automatically for them). Same time with that they increase rules,
   complexity and workload on developers - developers should remember and apply 1000001 rules. Usually they have force
   to push these rules. Some of these rules and requirements should be taken back and applied differently and supported
   by requesting side.
