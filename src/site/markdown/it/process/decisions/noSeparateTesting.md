# No separate requirements

When (requirements) described somewhere else, then these are tested somewhere else - not pushed/forced to the end of
the sprint for testing ending sprint results.

Examples:

* These are hidden requirements (sometimes not fully), applied with force (and fails sprint), without going through
  backlog for implementation. Everything should go through backlog - that's the goal of current requirement.
  Requirements should go through PBI.
* Analysts come in with separate requirements and testing aspects at the end of sprint. Some requirements are described
  in big document, somewhere, and tests are made by that. But current sprint PBI doesn't reflect it. Or reflect it as
  note. It is to huge thing to implement and test.
