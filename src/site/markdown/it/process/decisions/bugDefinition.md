# Bug definition

A software bug is defect and is a programming error that causes the software to function improperly or deviate from the
expected behavior, assuming that the expected behavior has been defined beforehand.

A software bug is the consequence of a programming error that results in unsatisfactory performance or a deviation from
the predefined specifications, requirements, or expectations. Before software development, there should be a clear
understanding of how the software should operate and what behavior is expected.

Specifications may include software features, user interfaces, performance levels, data input and output, and other
important behaviors. If the software does not meet these expectations or introduces unexpected behavior, it may indicate
a bug or programming error.

Bug detection often involves testing and comparing the actual behavior of the software with the expected behavior. If
there is a deviation or unsatisfactory result in the software's behavior, it may indicate a bug that needs to be fixed.

Examples:

1. Behavior is not defect, when that functionality was early defined as normal functionality. It is new functionality
   **enhancement**. It is defect of backlog, analyse, task or requirements/architecture (documentation) - no task given,
   wrongly given (with a few requirements) etc. Developer can handle bugs and enhancements differently and probably in
   smaller pieces.
