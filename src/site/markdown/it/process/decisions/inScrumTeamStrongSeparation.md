# In scrum Team Developers are PO are held more strongly separated

PO should stick to role and follow PBI rules - at the writing time, user story format.

No DB schemas, architecture blocks, communication schemas, ... - all that (architecture related) is Developers task and
responsibility to do without influence to architecture from PO/(business)analysts.

Examples:

* Sometimes PO tries to do Developers work, but PO is not implementing side, not responsible side. PO try to interact to
  developers work. PO cant design DB tables for example by ORM rules (or other development rules).
