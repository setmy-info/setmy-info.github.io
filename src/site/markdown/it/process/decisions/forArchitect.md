# Architect

Architects need to be critical and ask questions together with the product owner:
What is happening in the code?
What is the state of the code?
Where are the developers leading the code?
How do the developers plan to resolve the issue?
Does the developer want a PoC (proof of concept) or Spice?
How do you develop?
What data does the developer need for development?
How does the developer improve the code? What have the developers already started and how? For example, component
separation, process flow analysis (steps in this process, configuration options), notes/analysis regarding the process
flow you are involved in regarding DTO/VO/DataModel content.
What is the developers' vision of good code, solution, architecture, architectural directions, and why?
