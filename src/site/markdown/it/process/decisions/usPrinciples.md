User Story Implementation Rules and Principles

This document defines the rules and principles for implementing user stories.
The focus is on pragmatic, minimal-effort solutions and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

User stories should be implemented strictly within their defined scope.

The simplest viable interpretation of a user story should be preferred.

A deliberately lazy and pragmatic development approach is encouraged.

The shortest path to a working solution should be chosen.

Additional functionality must be explicitly justified.

* User stories should be kept to a minimum and created only when they provide clear value.
* Preference is given to simple and lazy solutions that require the least possible effort.
* The goal is to reach a working solution using the shortest and most straightforward path.
* Over-engineering should be avoided in favor of pragmatic and practical implementations.
* Complexity should only be introduced when it is clearly justified.

* Or: Favor minimal user stories, minimal effort, and the shortest path to a working solution.

* The implementation should prioritize minimal scope and minimal effort.
* Solutions should aim for the shortest path to functional delivery.
* User stories and tasks should be defined only to the extent strictly necessary.

User stories should not be expanded beyond what is required for implementation.

Implementations should follow the simplest possible interpretation of a user story.

The preferred approach is the one that requires the least effort and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Solutions should aim for the shortest path to a working and usable result.

Over-engineering should be avoided unless clearly justified by the requirements.

User stories should be implemented in the simplest possible way, with minimal effort and no unnecessary complexity.


User stories shall be implemented strictly according to their defined scope.

Any additional functionality beyond the user story must be explicitly justified.

Implementation decisions should favor minimal effort and the most direct solution.

Developed in a deliberately lazy and pragmatic manner. | Developed using a deliberately lazy approach, favoring simplicity and minimal effort.
A deliberately lazy development style is preferred, focusing on the simplest viable implementation.

Additional Principles

Excessive upfront planning should be avoided in favor of incremental and adaptive development.

User story decomposition and agile iteration enable progress toward longer-term goals without rigid long-term planning.

Direction toward long-term objectives is guided by analysts, architects, and product owners.

Development focuses on short, actionable steps while maintaining alignment with broader product vision.

Plans are expected to evolve as new information becomes available.

Avoid excessive upfront planning.
Agile user story decomposition enables progress toward long-term goals, guided by analysts, architects, and product owners.

Long-term detailed planning shall be minimized.

Strategic direction is provided by analysts, architects, and product owners.

Tactical execution is driven through small, incremental user stories.

Agile practices are used to balance short-term delivery with long-term objectives.
