# Analyze

## Methods

### 2-steps analysis: List All and Prove (LaP Analysis Method)

* List all aspects, arguments, elements, positions, views, opposing sides, etc., under a single topic or theme.
  If needed, divide the topics into a separate LaP analysis. This is a comprehensive listing of all options related to
  the subject (topic or theme).
* In the second stage, prove list item belongs or doesn't belong (should be removed) to list.
  Use a two-sided analysis if necessary to justify inclusion or exclusion.

### Two-Sided Analysis

### A

* Pros, positives, advantages, supporting arguments
* Cons, negatives, disadvantages, counterarguments

### B - more like LaP

* Aspects, arguments, elements, views, or entities from one perspective
* Corresponding opposing aspects, arguments, etc., from the other perspective
