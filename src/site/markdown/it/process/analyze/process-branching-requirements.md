# Requirements from process, roles, artifacts for branching and issue management

## Developers

1. Fewer branches to remember, and which is base branch (max 3 branches). Reason: Developer can produce many branches at
   development for refactor, adding tests, etc. And one change needed between different tasks. Branching-merging order
   hell.
2. Fast merge - max 2 hours.

## QA

1. Master should have quality checked code (reviewed, tested, other measurements).

## Business

1. Should be possible to add new requirements and bug fixes constantly by wish and need. Enhancements adding should not
   stop.
2. Enhancements should be released in any order.
