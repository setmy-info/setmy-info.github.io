# Lessons learned and retrospective from Fiverr

## Information

First try to get some developers, cheaper as possible. from cheaper countries, for small tasks, those development were
already postponed many years or decades.

## Negative

1. Developers can have fake account - not real programmer there, using someone else, real person identity with good
   background.
2. Developers there doesn't read task description through.
3. Like to get long conversation.
4. Like to get fast proposal.
5. Proposed simple Java task, for (by profile) high level professionals, got rejection because missing knowledge
6. Proposed simple Java task got over estimations. Looks like we should buy an air. Developers didn't read task, didn't
   concentrate. 100% of them.
7. None of professionals asked additional questions to understand task background in details. 100% of them.
8. Developers there are not ready to learn.

## Positive

## Conclusion

1. Need to have already good relationship with developers there, to get fast solutions, even for small amount of work.
2. Too much time for describing the task content, comparing to smaller tasks. Still better to do by our selves. To win
   additional human hours time can be therefore wast of time.
3. Send many requests same time. At least 10.
4. Time-consuming and arguing partners are not good partners - need to figure out quickly, by speech style, questions
   and lengthy conversation.
5. Also, not good partner, who doesn't read requirements through.
6. One 1:1 call needed (Google meet, Slack, Zoom) in the beginning, before price proposal approval.
7. Reject and ban fast.
8. Rejection, send immediately new proposal out.
