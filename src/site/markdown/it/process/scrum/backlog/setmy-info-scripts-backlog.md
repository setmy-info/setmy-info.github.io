# Stealer backlog

## Prerequisites and requirements

1. Repository: **git@xxxx** in [GitHub](https://github.com/xxxxxxxx)
2. Branch: **develop | master | epic**
3. **Java 21** (OpenJDK) or **multi-projects** property **java.version**
4. Modules to development: **java-vcs**, **java-staler**
5. **Lombok**, **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, **AssertJ** and modules dependencies only.
6. Prepare(d), fix and change repo A: **git@github.com:setmy-info/stealer-test-a.git**
7. Prepare(d), fix and change repo B: **git@github.com:setmy-info/stealer-test-b.git**
8. Stealer folder: **.stealer**  in working directory
9. Latest **Rocky** or **Fedora** Linux. Should run also on **Windows**.
10. **Unit tests** end with suffix **Test.java** and testable unit (under test) is method (function), other depending on
    units should be mocked out - if needed leave units as package level access. Should not depend on files and DB-s.
11. **Integration tests** end with suffix **IT.java** / can depend on files, config etc.
12. Try to hold as much as possible immutable classes.
13. No config files. Config related data model classes are populated by tests. Config parsing and populating is in
    another task, in CLI tool development task. CLI tool is not current task goal.
14. Good enough (unit tests) test coverage is 70%.
15. Integration tests should prove, that library is working.
16. First solution can have external command calling (Linux only). Existing scripts in **setmy-info-scripts** and other
    **multi-projects** libraries should be used.
