# Maven problems or criticism about maven

Some negative aspects people mention about Maven:

* **Long and verbose configuration** – the POM XML files can be very long, and many problems are said to arise from
  their
  length.
* **Rigid project structure** – Maven enforces a strict directory layout, which can limit flexibility.
* **Steep learning curve** – beginners may find it difficult to understand all conventions and the plugin system.
* **Slow build times** – especially in larger projects or when resolving many dependencies from remote repositories.
* **Plugin management complexity** – configuring and managing plugins can be more complicated than in Gradle.
* **Less flexibility compared to Gradle** – Gradle’s script-based approach allows more customization.

Upon deeper analysis, some of these criticisms may not be entirely accurate.
