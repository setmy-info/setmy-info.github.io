# GIT no additions

Git should be fast. We don't slow down our work. Install git and start work.

Examples:

* No (code) formatters, checkers at commit.
* No self made GIT plugins.
* No third party GIT plugins and no live testing with these.
* No exceptions right now.

Put these in to other places in process, use other techniques and tools.

Avoid after GIT install setup (and check) and preparation time, except mandatory (real name and email, no nickname).

GIT is related with CI and often changes are needed fast. Checkers are slowing down our work and someone is waiting.

Most of the cases third parties are not tested by Git developers (like old NASA analyse says about Windows, Linux nad
Solaris drivers development - probably Mac OS is now at the Solaris OS place). We don't investigate plugin suitability
to our projects, we don't handle (live testing) problems coming from plugins - wast of time.
