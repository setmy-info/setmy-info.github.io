# PWA First

Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) represent a convergence of native desktop applications, promoted/pushed forward by
the Web Consortium.

Respect is shown to users by eliminating the necessity to install multiple applications for different purposes.

For developers, the transition to PWAs doesn't necessitate acquiring new skills. Instead, it leverages the existing
expertise of full-stack developers.

Users still have the ability to "install" individual sub-apps within the SMI ecosystem, as well as "install" a root app
that contains all sub-apps, ensuring accessibility and convenience.
