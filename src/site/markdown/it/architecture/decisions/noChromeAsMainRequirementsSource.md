# No Chrome browser as main requirements source

We have long epoch and experience supporting IE in web applications, trying to implement Microsoft "standards" and now
we are back is similar situation.

* Requirement: should support Chrome, is too abstract. What exactly? [NTLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM) also?
  Really?
* Mozilla: We implement standards only (for now we know there are some exceptions in that promise - PWA installation
  support for example). But still FF == WEB standard (or almost).
* Chrome Standards = standards - something + N x f(). That means, not all things are implemented (as long they are not
  promising something similar to Mozilla, currently not) added N number of unknown functionalities.

When Chrome is requirement:

1. What exactly should be implemented or what functionalities should be considered and supported?
2. Who makes the list (analysis) of unknown functionalities?
3. Who makes the list (analysis) of missing standards functionalities?
