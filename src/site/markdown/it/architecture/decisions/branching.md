# Branching

* git flow (Vincent Driessen aka [nvie], https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
  master, default, feature, release branches. master should be releasable at any moment without thinking (investigating,
  analyzing) about latest tag's investigation, thinking.
* flexible but complex internal branching schema:
  N number of branches per release items - release branches
  Releasing at any time, any order
  Handling releases or hotfixes same way.

Currently **master**. All branches should be renamed same time to **default** or main or trunk.
