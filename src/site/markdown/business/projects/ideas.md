# Project ideas list

## List

Learning project ideas

* Stealer Java library and CLI to finish. Git Java lib enhancements have to be made, to use Git Java library (JGit).
* Ideal domain model example for JPA/Hibernate for later implementation (1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:N) for JPA ORM model
  generation, for documentation, discussions.
* Lombok and maven plugin: JSON model to a) JPA ORM model generation. Templating engine decision. b) DAO/Repository
  generator c) model to DTO generation. d) Controller generator e) Services generator. f) Change applier. FreeMarker is
  default option.
* Public Less/CSS module, as GIT submodule or ... - PoC how to include into application.
* JSON + HTML + JS Documentation format into separate module. Rich text HTML editor. More controlls, like information
  levels, profiles/selections.
* antlr Java, Groovy, XML, JSON, (Ba)sh, Markdown PoC.
* Documentation piece "stealer"/combiner (by doc piece address, URI) and new doc assembler. Java DTO model.
* Handwriting HTML drawing canvas library. Plugin/handler extendable. Handlet.
* Estonian XBLR building from XSD. Research PoC needed.
* Content server API. Needs stealer to be finished. Or maven archetype plugin to generate projects (spring boot
  template).
* Content Server Web application.
* Maven archetype plugin project PoC. To generate new maven project. Templating engine decision must be made (Probably
  FreeMarker vs Velocity or Thymeleaf). FreeMarker is NetBeans class generator.
* Java Geometry library and PoC: combine objects operations.
* Python .venv folder can it be under ~/.smi-python (for example) per module project (~/.smi-python/module-abc-xyz)
  directory name.
* PoC/Research FE Angular or other FW to load automatically HTML templates and code for it. REST endpoint can respond
  with componentId: 1-1000000000. By componentId load template and code and shows at placeholder.
* Public web pages scraping modules. Text parsing to PostGis (text geometry on page).
* SMI scripts upgrade, add Liquibase command (smi-liquibase) to change PosgreSQL and/or H2 file DB. Driver, script dir,
  entry, db, host, user, password.
* smi-install-package etc to Windows
* Person names (first, last, middle etc), email, username faker/tokenizer API.
* GDPR ruleset API and web APP for web page and company data usage terms.
* Web3 related modules. Research PoC needed.
* Contracts in-house SPA enhancement.
* SPA for Kubernetes config generation.
* Mini accounting software.
* Mini inventory/storage accounting software
* Mini crm software.
* Mini HR software. Like Bob. Vacations, ill, holidays, etc.
* Quiz form.
* Mini Scrum board.
* HTML, Native JS and Angular Calendar Component.
* PoC: WebRTC (?) - take USB/Webcam picture, mobile cam picture.
* PoC: Video file (mpg4) get frame by frame from stream for processing (save picture to jpg/png). Java, C/C++.
* PoC: LAS/LAZ parser and transformer into binary proprietary format.
* PoC: NSIS example. CMake ?
* PoC: e-Bills
* PoC: SMS payments
* PoC: WASM
* PoC: WASM + Kubernetes
* Mini static web page generator
* Generic protocol library (like workflow/process engine) - defined steps and flow steps to steps. Steps reading,
  writing, deciding, counter. Tgread runs protocol, protocol contains steps, steps do collect data to model(s), protocol
  has context, context is passed to steps, steps are for reading, writing, counting, incrementing. Protocol (steps flow)
  is defined by config. Library user should implement "connection" code for steps, where or to data is set or taken. Or
  config tels a variable name (in context/data collector).
* [Low level protocol](io-protocol/index.md).
