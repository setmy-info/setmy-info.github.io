**PASGT** (Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops) â€“ Full Cut / Low Cut. **Traditional design**, provides **maximum
coverage**
over ears and nape.

* **Heavier**, but gives **more protection**.
* Limited compatibility with **modern comms/headsets**.
* Great for **static defense**, trench warfare, and when adding **ballistic face/front plates**.
* _Used as a base for many military helmets. Common in older NATO forces._

**MICH** (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet) â€“ Mid Cut

* Covers ears partially, allowing space for communication headsets.
* Better balance of protection and comfort.
* Often used by regular infantry and law enforcement.
* Good for general tactical or protective use.
* _Still widely used across NATO and civilian markets._

**FAST** (Future Assault Shell Technology) â€“ High Cut

* Features **high-cut sides**, fully exposing ears.
* Optimized for use with **active hearing protection, comms, NVGs, and rail mounts**.
* **Lightweight and modular**, ideal for high mobility and customization.
* Slightly **less ballistic coverage** compared to PASGT or MICH.
* _Standard for special forces and increasingly popular in civilian/tactical use._

Similar or identical to **FAST** helmets.
Ideal for attaching gear and improving situational awareness.
