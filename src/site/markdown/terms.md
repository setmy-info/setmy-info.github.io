**Deploy** - evitama, juurutama

**Install** - paigaldama

**Multi-Tenant** - multitenancy, simply: single application for all users.

**Idempotent** - Idempotentsus. Results of action/functon/process are same for same input.

**Entity** - Entiteet, olem.

**Heterogeneous collection** - any type of data in collection.

**Homogeneous collection** - single type of data in collection.

**Homoiconic** - code as data. Code used as a data.

**Exception** - erand. (Et tagada Tõrketõrjed).

**Name-mangling** - nimemuserdus.

**Escape character** - põgenemismärk, põgenemistähis

**Tethering mode** - lõastamisrežiimiks - ligipääsupunktide (access point) loomise režiim

**TechEx** - Technological Exploration: Spike or PoC.

**String** - sõne.

**Plugin** - pistik.

**Thread** - lõim.

**Thread safety** - lõimekindlus.

**Value objekt** - väärtusobjekt. Identity depends on objet properties/attribute alues.

**Immutability** - muutumatus.

**Duck typing** - this principle states that "if it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then
it's probably a duck." In other words, an object's type is determined based on its behavior rather than its class name.
Object properties define an object type.

**Structural typing** - (Go, Elm, ..) typing based on checking an object's properties and structure
to determine compatibility, regardless of class name matching.

**Nominal typing** - (Mostly Java, C++) typing based on class names; two objects must be of the same class to be
considered the same type,
regardless of property alignment.

**Type inference** - the programming language automatically deduces object types based on their usage and properties,
reducing the need for explicit type declarations.

**Latent typing** - Object types are not strictly defined and can be partially hidden or dynamically determined based on
behavior.

**Behavioral typing** - typing based on an object's behavior, focusing on available methods and functions rather than
the class it belongs to.

**Ad-hoc polymorphism** - different objects can have methods or functions with the same name, but their behavior varies
depending on the object's type or properties.

**Concept-based typing** - objects are classified into types based on the concepts or properties they exhibit, allowing
more flexibility in type control.

**Vendor lock in** - müüjale lukustumine (sõltuvus müüjast, raskendatud migratsioon, lukustatud ökosüsteem, pikaajalised
kulud).

**PWA** - Progressive Web App. Offline + like a desktop application.

**SPA** - Single-Page Application. Loaded single html with dynamic updates in it.

**MPA** - Multi-Page Application. Traditional multiple pages loading.

**Responsive design*** - seadmetundlik disain.

**Ubiquitous language** - (Üldkasutatav keel) using a common, shared vocabulary and terms, those can be understood by
technical and non-technical team members (developers, domain experts, and stakeholders).

**pure function** - no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference
arguments or input/output streams), idempotent, no mutable variables.

**Factual Forced Development** - my own term for management driven development. Com with fact, that promised to do
development for particular date, need to be done, because already agreed, without team. Putting team to face facts,
therefore forcing it through that to be done (over time).

**FFD** - Fact-Forced Development. Development where management, at any level, imposes sudden decisions, requirements,
or deadlines as established “facts.” These top-down mandates force development teams to rework plans, adjust priorities,
or extend working hours in order to stay on schedule. A source of stress, inefficiency, and reduced product quality.
A top-down anti-pattern where management imposes sudden “facts” that force teams to replan, work overtime,
and sacrifice quality to meet imposed deadlines.
