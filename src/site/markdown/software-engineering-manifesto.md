# Manifesto for Software Engineering

## Architecture Awareness & Collaboration

Technology choices are not unrestricted by default. Therefore, we make every effort to ensure that the views of a wide
range of individuals, and in particular software architects, are taken into account.

We do not expect architecture to be memorized by anyone. We expect it to be re-checked, reviewed, prepared at first,
then consulted during implementation.

Engineers actively collaborate with architects and are responsible for understanding, following, and validating their
implementation against approved architecture decisions, non-functional requirements, technologies, approaches, and
relevant documentation.

When seeking information, a developer must follow this order: internal wiki first, then AI/assistants, then Google or
Stack Overflow, then colleagues.

If rules, guidelines, best practices, principles, or coding standards are missing, developers take the initiative to
present proposals to architects for approval.

We use proper tools and format for architectural communication.

The development team explains exactly how features will be implemented during sprint planning. Check out
the [Scrum Guide Sprint planning](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#topic-three-how-will-the-chosen-work-get-done)

Engineers/Developers clearly express their know-how, knowledge. Communicate what they truly understand and can
implement.

AI tools may be used to assist in preparing architecture proposals or documentation, while final decisions
remain with architects.

Code reviews are the starting point for discussions. Code reviews are used to share and increase team know-how about
architectural decisions, coding styles, and best practices.

All architectural decisions and coding practices should be made transparently and documented in advance.
