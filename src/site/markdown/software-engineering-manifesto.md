# Manifesto for Software Engineering

## Architecture Awareness & Collaboration

Technology choices are not unrestricted by default. Therefore, we make every effort to ensure that the views of a wide
range of individuals, and in particular software architects, are taken into account.

We do not expect architecture to be memorized by anyone. We expect it to be re-checked, reviewed, prepared at first,
then consulted during implementation.

Engineers actively collaborate with architects and are responsible for understanding, following, and validating their
implementation against approved architecture decisions, non-functional requirements, technologies, approaches, and
relevant documentation.

**DRAFT**: / When rules, guidelines, best practices, principles, or coding standards are not defined, developers
proactively
propose them to architects for review and adoption. | If rules, guidelines, best practices, principles, or coding
standards are missing, developers take the initiative to present proposals to architects for approval. / Architecture
proposals must
follow the ADR format.

We use proper tools for architectural communication.

The development team explains exactly how features will be implemented during sprint planning. Check out
the [Scrum Guide Sprint planning](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#topic-three-how-will-the-chosen-work-get-done)

**DRAFT**: Engineers/Developers clearly express their know-how, knowledge. Communicate what they truly understand and
can implement, ~~and what they cannot, rather than just saying "We can do."~~

**DRAFT**: AI tools may be used to assist in preparing architecture proposals or documentation, while final decisions
remain with
architects.

**DRAFT**: When seeking information, a developer must follow this order: internal wiki first, then AI/assistants, then
Google or Stack Overflow, then colleagues.

**DRAFT**: Code reviews are used to share and increase team know-how about architectural decisions, coding styles, and
best practices.

All architectural decisions and coding practices should be made transparently and documented in advance.
