# Manifesto for Software Engineering

## Architecture Awareness & Collaboration

Engineers actively collaborate with architects and are responsible for understanding and following approved
architecture decisions, non-functional requirements, technologies, approaches, and relevant documentation.

We do not expect architecture to be memorized. We expect it to be re-checked, reviewed, prepared, and consulted during
implementation. ~~Developers commit to reviewing relevant architecture documentation and validating their
implementations, as well as their chosen technologies, frameworks, and tools, against it.~~

Technology choices are not unrestricted by default.

The development team explains exactly how features will be implemented during sprint planning. Check out
the [Scrum Guide Sprint planning](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#topic-three-how-will-the-chosen-work-get-done)

DRAFT

Developers clearly communicate what they truly understand and can implement, and what they cannot, rather than just
saying "We can do."

/ When rules, guidelines, best practices, principles, or coding standards are not defined, developers proactively
propose
them to architects for review and adoption. | If rules, guidelines, best practices, principles, or coding standards are
missing, developers take the initiative to present proposals to architects for approval. / Architecture proposals must
follow the ADR format.

AI tools may be used to assist in preparing architecture proposals or documentation, while final decisions remain with
architects.

When seeking information, a developer must follow this order: internal wiki first, then colleagues, then AI/assistants,
and finally external sources such as Google or Stack Overflow.

Code reviews are used to share and discover architectural decisions, coding styles, and best practices.
increase team know-how

All architectural decisions and coding practices should be made transparently and documented in advance.
