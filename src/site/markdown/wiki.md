# Wiki

## Documentation wiki structure hierarchy standard

This documentation is in *Draft* status for version: 1.0.0

Implementation is at [index page](index.html) and in maven site.

Shortly perhaps one of these: _**DWS**_ or ~~**DWSH**~~ or ~~**DWSHS**~~

Wiki structure in software development point of view.
Also a little bit in busines stakeholders point of view.

Business and IT can be in wiki under separate starting root pages. That holds wiki structure a in flat sstructure.
This way most of the structure stays 3 level, only some parts have deeper hierarchy.

Prefer longer pages under hierarch section. Use different headings, prefer 3 levels: H1, H2 and H3.
